- :computer: Master's in artificial intelligence at Duke University (08/2021-)
- :mortar_board: Bachelor's in electrical engineering from the University of Notre Dame '21
- :keyboard: VS Code gang (how do you exit VIM?!?)
- :fire: Data science and machine learning

I am a recent graduate of the University of Notre Dame with a bachelor's in electrical engineering, and a current master's student at Duke University studying artificial intelligence. I love data, college football (go Irish ☘️ !!), working out, and spending time with my family and friends. 

I just completed my first semester at Duke University. I love the school, my professors, and the area. It's amazing what the weather in Durham, NC can do for you after spending the last 4 years in freezing and cloudy northern Indiana!

- ☁️ Continuous integration & delivery
- ✍️ Strong verbal and written communication skills

## 🚀 Future plans

I am currently looking for a full time role in data science/machine learning at a company that champions innovation and a culture of collaboration. I take tremendous pride in and ownership of my work, I'm a very fast learner, and I love working with people and being a part of something bigger than myself.
