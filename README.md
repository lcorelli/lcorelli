# Hi, I'm Leo 🚀 💻 :)
<p align="center"><img align="center" width="1100px" src="assets/duke_main_drive.jpg"></p>

I am a recent graduate of the University of Notre Dame with a bachelor's in electrical engineering, and a current master's student at Duke University studying artificial intelligence. I love data, college football (Go Irish ☘️ !!), working out, and spending time with my family and friends.
