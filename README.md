## :book: About me
- :computer: Master's student studying artificial intelligence at Duke University (08/2021-)
- :mortar_board: Bachelor's in electrical engineering from the University of Notre Dame (08/2017-05/2021)
- :fire: 
- :keyboard: VS Code gang (how do you exit VIM?!?)
- :eyes: 

I am a recent graduate of the University of Notre Dame with a bachelor's in electrical engineering, and a current master's student at Duke University studying artificial intelligence. I love data, college football (go Irish ☘️ !!), working out, and spending time with my family and friends. 

I just completed my first semester at Duke University. I love the school, my professors, and the area. It's amazing what the weather in Durham, NC can do for you after spending the last 4 years in freezing and cloudy northern Indiana!

## 💻 Skills
- 👨‍💻 Python: OOP principles, numpy, pandas, sklearn, pytorch
- 🧮 Math & Statistics: Linear algebra, multivariable calculus and differential equations, statistical learning methods, exploratory data analysis 
- 💾 Version control: I can push/pull, init/clone, add, and commit. I'm a work in progress with branching :)
- ✍️ Strong verbal and written communication skills
- 😁 An infectiously positive attitude and strong willingness to learn!

## 🚀 Future plans

At the moment I do not have any professional experience working as a data scientist. I have been working relentlessly over the past 7 months both on my own and in school to learn, practice, and become a true data scientist. I am building my github repositories so that everyone can see what I have been working on. I am currently looking for a 2022 data science summer internship to continue my learning process. I take tremendous pride in and ownership of my work, I'm a very fast learner, and I love working with people and being a part of something bigger than myself.
