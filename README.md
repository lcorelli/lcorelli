## :book: About me
- :computer: Artificial Intelligence master's student at Duke University (08/2021~)
- :mortar_board: BS in electrical engineering from the University of Notre Dame (08/2017-05/2021)
- :fire: 
- :keyboard: VS Code gang (how do you exit VIM?!?)
- :eyes: 

I am a recent graduate of the University of Notre Dame with a bachelor's in electrical engineering, and a current master's student at Duke University studying artificial intelligence. I love data, college football (go Irish ☘️ !!), working out, and spending time with my family and friends. 

I just completed my first semester at Duke University. I love the school, my professors, and the area. It's amazing what the weather in Durham, NC can do for you after spending the last 4 years in northern Indiana.
